#### Usage
##### Creating games
You can search for courses where you want to create a game by tapping the Create Game tab at the bottom.  If there are courses near your geolocation these will appear first, otherwise you may search by city, course name, or zipcode. By tapping a course in the tableview you will be directed to a screen with more info about the golf course.  Here you can see any other games that have been created for this course.  If you want to create a game at this course choose Create Game at the top right.  This will take you to the Create Game screen.  Enter the desired tourney title, handicap range, date, and buy-in amount (Maximum $10).  Once you click create you will be redirected back to your user profile and the created game will now be shown under your current games.  
##### Cancelling games
If you'd like to cancel the game, tap the game in your profile and choose cancel game at the top.  
##### Finding and joining existing games
To find and join games created by other users tap the Find Games tab.  Games near your geolocation will appear first if they exist, otherwise you can search by city, course name, or zipcode. If you tap a game that appears you will be brought to a screen with more game info, such as current players that have joined the game.  To join the game, tap the Join button in the top right.
